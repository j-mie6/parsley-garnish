# Parsley Garnish
This repo houses the `parsley`-specific version of the `lift-plugin` and its syntax overloading plugin
into one `parsley-garnish` plugin.

## `lift-plugin`: [Originally](https://github.com/mpickering/lift-plugin) by *mpickering* (Matthew Pickering)
Automatically lift functions and values using `code`, built as a Typechecker Plugin.

By using `overload`, functions can be written to be injected into `WQ` or `Defunc` using regular
syntax.
